title:  "Modern C++ shinanegans with Vertices in OpenGL!"

Recommended Modern C++ topics to review before reading: `auto` return types, Variadic templates, `constexpr` (and extended) functions, `using` alias, `type_traits`, inline static variables...

For those who are new to graphics programming, understanding the concept of an OpenGL "Vertex" might take longer than learning it from 10th Grade Geometry class. Ask your "Average Joe" what the definition of a "Vertex" and likely you'll get a response along the lines of "Some pointy spot on a shape". While this is not at all wrong, in a graphics programming context, there's much more to that than the relative positions within a geometry.

```cpp
void glVertexAttribPointer(
    GLuint index,
	GLint size,
	GLenum type,
	GLboolean normalized,
	GLsizei stride,
	const GLvoid * pointer);
```

Let's idealize the concept of a Vertex Attribute using C++. For now, we'll naively just put each parameter into a struct.

```cpp
struct VertexAttribute {
  GLuint index;
  GLuint size;
  GLint count;
  GLenum type;
  GLbyte normalized;
  GLsizei strideSize,
  const GLvoid * offset;
};
```
Not a bad start; however, there are some things that would be slightly awkward to implement:
1. `index` A specific vertex attribute should be agnostic of other surrounding attributes. If this is the case, `index` should probably be assigned or managed by a foreign entity.
2. I'm more a fan of `count` than `size` here as we're referring to a specific enumeration of components within the attribute and not how big or small (in terms of memory usage) the components are individually.
3. The 'type' parameter is pretty interesting. From a C++ perspective, one might want to make this into a template which could take the various GL types (GLfloat, GLint, etc...). We'll just hold on to that idea for now.
4. Normalized is pretty straightforward. GL_TRUE vs GL_FALSE.
5. Similar to point number 1, each component should be blind to the existence of its surroundings. We'll have something else handle this for us.

The second iteration of this idea would look something along the lines of:


```cpp
template<typename GLType>
struct VertexAttribute {
  GLint count;
  GLenum type;
  GLuint typeSize;
  GLbyte normalized;
};
```

Much easier to manage and populate in my opinion. Naturally, the next thing to address is how these attributes are laid out in memory. We'll refer to this structure as a `layout`. Or simply something like:

```cpp
struct VertexLayout {
  std::vector<VertexAttribute> layout;
};
```

except that we're going to, again, make a few changes...Since we know a-prori what our layout should look like, there isn't any reason why we can't make this an array.

```cpp
template<std::size_t NumComponents>
struct VertexLayout {
  std::array<VertexAttribute, NumComponents> layout;
};
```

This is looking like something we can start to easily use. But here's the kicker: We want to be more descriptive up-front of what these vertex attributes are. For example, assume we want a vertex layout that contains: 3D position, 3D normals, and textures. We have three attributes here but a total of eight components (x, y, z, nX, nY, nZ, u, and v). We can use the type sytem to alias what these attributes are for ease of mixing and matching different types of vertices.

```cpp
using vPos3D = VertexComponent<3>;
using vNor3D = VertexComponent<3>;
using vTex = VertexComponent<2>;
```

Using these aliases, we can more easily communicate the structure of the vertices without having to guess what `VertexLayout<8>` means. Something along the lines of `VertexLayout<vPos3D, vNor3D, vTex>` is much easier to identify, and the layout can be determined statically without much work.

Let's try to see what this would look like:

```cpp
template<typename... VertexComponentTs>
struct VertexLayout {
  static constexpr std::array<VertexAttribute, sizeof...(VertexComponentTs)>
      layout{getAttribute<VertexComponentTs>()...};
};
```
Lovely. For all layouts of a given template instantiation, they should be identical, hence `static`. The constexpr here implies `inline` thus we are not required to have the defintion of `layout` in a .cpp file. Thank you C++17.

To populate this array, we expand it from a `VertexAttribute` generator aptly named `getAttribute`.

```cpp
template <typename VertexComponentT>
constexpr auto getAttribute() {
  using value_type = typename VertexComponentT::value_type;
  if constexpr (std::is_same_v<value_type, GLfloat>) {
    return VertexAttribute{VertexComponentT::size,
                           getGLTypeEnum<VertexComponentT>(),
                           sizeof(value_type), GL_FALSE};
  }
  return VertexAttribute{VertexComponentT::size,
                         getGLTypeEnum<VertexComponentT>(), sizeof(value_type),
                         GL_FALSE};
}
```


The first line in the function body retrives the type of the VertexComponentGroup. For example, `vPos`, `vNor`, and `vTex` will all be GLfloat. If you wanted, you can make a VertexComponentGroup like `vPriority` which contains only `GLint`s that you can use for some ranking system for vertices, etc...Most of the time, I would wager that GLfloat would be used in most attributes. From here you can simply check the type against `GLfloat` and see whether or not if they're the same type using metafunctions/type_traits like `std::is_same`. If we know the type of the attributes, we can simply take the size of that type and retrive the corresponding `GLenum`.


And with that, we're almost done. We just need to make that `VertexComponentGroup` struct and then add some nice API to `VertexLayout`.

First, remember that we'd like to call `VertexComponentGroup` this way:

```cpp
using vPos3D = VertexComponent<3>;
```

Obviously, we need to construct a template for this class which accepts at least one template argument. The other argument will be the type argument named `value_type` that we used in `getAttribute`.

```cpp
template <std::size_t ComponentSize, typename ValueType>
struct VertexComponentGroup {
  using value_type = ValueType;
  static constexpr std::size_t size = ComponentSize;
};
```

OK. But earlier we didn't specify the type? Correct. We did not. As said before, GLfloat is assumed to be our default type unless we're doing something unique like `vPriority`.

Final thing I want to add is actual API that you will use on the OpenGL interface. We'll simply make this a template function which takes in `VertexComponentGroups` as arguments. We'll call this Vertex.

```cpp
using vPos3D = VertexComponentGroup<3>;
using vNor3D = VertexComponentGroup<3>;
using vTex = VertexComponentGroup<2>;
using Vertex3D = Vertex<vPos3D, vNor3D, vTex>;
```

I find the API to be clear. We have a type called `Vertex3D` which is composed of a 3D position, 3D normal, and a texture coordinates. Again, you can add, remove, mix this up with a lot of flexibility.

```cpp
template <typename... VertexComponentTs>
struct Vertex {
  static constexpr std::size_t totalComponentSize = (VertexComponentTs::size + ...);
  static constexpr VertexLayout<VertexComponentTs...> layout{};
  static auto& getLayout() { return layout; }
};
```
Viola. The layout is ready for use for the VAO. One quick note about Visual Studio 2017: `VertexComponentsTs::size + ...)` wont work until Visual Studio 2019. We can provide quick workaround for that:

```cpp
/*
 * Needed until Visual Studio 2019...
 */
template <typename... VertexComponentTs>
constexpr auto getTotalComponentSize() {
  return (VertexComponentTs::size + ...);
}

//...

template <typename... VertexComponentTs>
struct Vertex {
  static constexpr std::size_t totalComponentSize = 
  		getTotalComponentSize<VertexComponentTs..>();
  static constexpr VertexLayout<VertexComponentTs...> layout{};
  static auto& getLayout() { return layout; }
};
```


```cpp
  template <typename VBOish, typename VertexLayoutT>
  void addBuffer(const VBOish& vbo, const VertexLayoutT& layout) {
    bind();
    vbo.bind();
    auto offset{0u};
    auto stride = layout.getStride();
    for (const auto& layout_component : layout) {
      glEnableVertexAttribArray(m_arraySize);
      glVertexAttribPointer(m_arraySize, layout_component.count,
                            layout_component.type, layout_component.normalized,
                            stride, reinterpret_cast<GLvoid*>(offset));
      offset += layout_component.count * layout_component.typeSize;
      m_arraySize++;
    }
    vbo.unbind();
    unbind();
  }
```
We've taken care of the `index` and `offset` parameters that were introduced ealier in this post. We can simply pass in a VBO object and a Vertex::layout and we'll just make the right calls to `glVertexAttribPointer`.
